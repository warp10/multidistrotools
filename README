MultiDistroTools
================

Most of the user documentation is on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiDistroTools .
The easiest way to learn how mdt is to use the inline help : just run
"mdt" with any arguments.

Developer documentation
-----------------------
debian/ contains the files needed to build the Debian package.
scripts/ contains all the real scripts that do the real work.
manpages/ contains the manpage's source and mdt.1.
mdt is a ruby script that does the option parsing and calls the script
   that does the real work.

To write your own script:
- add it in scripts/
- export MDT_SCRIPTSDIR=scripts/
- add it to mdt, in the COMMANDS array (should be easy to figure out)
- run ./mdt yourcommand youroptions
- debug ;)

You can also run scripts/yourscript.ext directly.

Doing PATH=$(pwd):$PATH will help if your script call other MultiDistroTools
scripts.
